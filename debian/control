Description: a DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) and AM Software Defined Radio
 Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) is the digital radio standard for the
 long-, medium- and short-wave ranges. The standard was formed by a
 consortium in co-operation with the International Telecommunication
 Union (ITU).  For more information visit www.drm.org.  Dream uses the
 sound card as the input and output device. A long, medium and short wave
 front-end with an intermediate frequency (IF) between 5 kHz and 15 kHz
 is used to receive the DRM signal. Any commercial front-end with an IF
 of 455 kHz should be usable by adding a 455 kHz to 12 kHz adaptor
 (assuming the receiver bandwidth is sufficient for a DRM signal).
 Documentation of receiver modifications for DRM reception can be found
 at www.drmrx.org.
