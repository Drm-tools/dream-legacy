 * Description:
 *	Implements Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) Multiplex Distribution Interface
 *	(MDI), Receiver Status and Control Interface (RSCI)  
 *  and Distribution and Communications Protocol (DCP) as described in
 *	ETSI TS 102 820,  ETSI TS 102 349 and ETSI TS 102 821 respectively.
 *
 *  This module derives, from the CTagItemDecoder base class, tag item decoders specialised to decode each of the tag
 *  items defined in the control part of RSCI.
 *  Decoded commands are generally sent straight to the CDRMReceiver object which
 *	they hold a pointer to.
