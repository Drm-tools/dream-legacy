Introduction
------------

The bandwidth of a DRM bandpass signal is less than 20 kHz and the number of 
carriers used in the OFDM-modulation is relatively small (max. 460). These
features motivate a real-time software implementation of a DRM-receiver on a 
conventional personal computer (PC) using the sound card as the input and output 
device. A long, medium and short wave front-end with an intermediate frequency 
(IF) between 5 kHz and 15 kHz is used to receive the DRM signal. Any commercial 
front-end with an IF of 455 kHz should be usable by adding a 455 kHz to 12 kHz 
adaptor (asumed the receiver bandwith is sufficient for a DRM signal). 
Documentation of receiver modifications for DRM reception can be found at 
www.drmrx.org. 

With this software project we intend to implement a working software receiver 
with, at least, the basic features. Since this project is created at a university 
and the fundamental idea of such an institution is to teach and stimulate the 
creativity, this source-code is free under the GNU-General Public License (GPL). 
Dream is a development project which uses the open source model to improve DRM 
technology. The main aim of this project is to implement and test new research 
results on an existing system, whereby the synchronization and channel 
estimation is of special interest. 
 
The programming-language is C++. The final release is intended to run under 
Microsoft Windows and Linux. Start of the project was June 2001. 
 
Although this software is going to be distributed as free software under the 
terms of the GPL this does not mean that its use is free of rights of others. 
The use may infringe third party IP and thus may not be legal in some countries.
