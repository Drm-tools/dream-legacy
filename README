Project objectives:
    - Build a real-time DRM-receiver on a conventional PC with the sound card 
	using as input and output device


With this software project, we intend to implement a working software receiver 
with, at least, the basic features. Since this project is created at a 
university and the fundamental idea of such an institution is to teach and 
stimulate the creativity, this source-code is free under the GNU-General 
Public License (GPL). 
 
The main aim of this project is to implement and test new research results on 
an existing system and evaluate the results, whereby the synchronization and 
channel estimation is of special interest. 
 
The programming-language is C++. The final release is intended to run under 
Microsoft Windows and Linux. Start of the project was June 2001. 
 
Although this software is going to be distributed as free software under the 
terms of the GPL this does not mean that its use is free of rights of others. 
The use may infringe third party IP and thus may not be legal in some countries.
